# Contribute
Thanks for considering to contribute to the building of this app.
The app structure is just like any web app. Load this directory using any of your favorite web server.
Currently this is a Single page application and has all the UI in index.html
js/app.js has the logic for the application.
Have fun hacking the app. Go Tigers!!!
